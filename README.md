# Seiko uc-2000 reverse engineering

This is a project to restore of instruction set for Seiko UC-2000 and analogs. The goal of this project is to write first third-party application (even more - first program in more than 30 years) for these early smart watches.


**./rom**<br />
Contains 5 applications from the original ROM that came with the UC-2200. These files were taken from http://www.sigma957.org/datagraph.html

**./docs**<br />
Manuals and other documents.

**./ads**<br />
Scans of ads and magazine cuttings.

**./axasm**<br />
Assembler for Seico Cal. UW01 (UW02), I used axasm by Al Williams (https://github.com/wd5gnr/axasm)

**./ucDisassembler**<br />
Very simple disassembler, but without which I would not have managed (Source code of applications from the ROM are in **./rom/disassembled**)
